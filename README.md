## Introduction

The Crime News API allows you to retrieve news articles based on a specific location (zipcode), filter these articles for content related to crime, violence, accidents, and death, and analyze the sentiment of the filtered articles. This can be useful for various applications, such as analyzing the overall sentiment of news in a particular area or identifying news events related to specific keywords.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.7+
*   pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RJBOGA/newsapi.git
    cd newsapi
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  Activate the virtual environment:

    *   On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (Make sure you create the `requirements.txt` that contains the libraries)
    ```
    Flask
    python-dotenv
    requests
    beautifulsoup4
    nltk
    flasgger
    ```

## Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

2.  Add your News API key to the `.env` file:

    ```
    NEWSAPI_KEY=YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY` with your actual News API key. You can obtain a News API key from [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/).

3.  Download the `uszipcsv.csv` file and place it in the root directory of the project. You may need to find a suitable CSV file containing US zipcode data with city, state, latitude, and longitude information.

## Running the Application

1.  Activate the virtual environment (if you haven't already).

2.  Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    This will start the Flask development server. You can access the API endpoints at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address shown in the terminal output).
